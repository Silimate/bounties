# Bounties

This is a list of open-source bounties that would be useful to Silimate. Please contact akash@silimate.com or create an issue in this repo if you are interested in one of these, to align on success criteria and implementation strategy.

Completion of one of the technical bounties worth >$1000 qualifies you for a final-round interview with Silimate, if you'd like to work with us.

## Open-source Liaison

We regularly upstream our features/bugfixes to keep our changes in sync and get feedback from maintainers.

However, we currently have a large number of changes in our forks that we would like to upstream but do not have time to do ourselves. If you are able to upstream any of these (plus whatever edits are required by the project maintainers), you will earn a small reward ($50-100/item, depending on complexity, please discuss with us).
