# Liberty CCS Pruning

The idea of this bounty is to create a program to read in a Liberty file and output a filtered version of that Liberty file without CCS groups/attributes.

This should use OpenSTA's Liberty parser for consistency. You may use https://github.com/Silimate/liberty2json as a starting point or you may integrate this directly in OpenSTA.

## Success Criteria

Create a repo called `prune-liberty-ccs` with instructions on how to input the Liberty files and output the final files that are needed.
